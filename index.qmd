## Why is census data important?{.arg-title91}

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="3%"}

:::

::: {.column width="97%"}


- Helps understand the population's characteristics and needs.

- Is essential for designing effective public policies (social, economic, and territorial planning).

- Serves as a vital component of academic, social, and market research.

- Forms the foundation for evidence-based decision-making.

## The 2022 Census Operation{.arg-title91}

<br>

::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="10%"}

:::

::: {.column width="90%"}
Argentina conducted its national census in 2022, the country's largest statistical operation. Starting in 2023, we began publishing the final results, to which I contributed.

In addition to presenting the data, we had to edit and generate hundreds of Excel tables using R, which was a very manual process.

##  An idea in the middle of chaos{.arg-title91}

::: {.columns}


::: {.column width="30%"}
<br>

![](images/fine.png)

:::

::: {.column width="70%"}

We had to make many Excel tables. We didn't know if they were useful or even usable. During that process, I thought **this should be a package in R**, but the idea remained up in the air until rOpenSci Champions appeared and took shape.

## rOpenSci Champions Program  {.arg-title5}

This is a programme that promotes leadership in open science and free software. It offers mentoring and peer support, particularly for individuals from historically underrepresented groups.

## What was (is) my project?  {.arg-title5}

<br>


**Develop an R data package that makes available the official national population census data of Argentina**, produced by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC), covering the period from 1970 to 2022. The data are homogenized, organized, and ready to use. The package provides open access to these datasets, facilitating their use by the public, researchers, and decision-makers.


## Why? {.arg-title5}

<br>

Historical census results for **1970, 1980, 1991, 2001, 2010 and 2022** in Argentina are available in different formats through physical books, PDFs, excel files, and REDATAM outputs, without having a unified system or format that would allow working with the data from these six census periods as a database.

This fragmentation limits data accessibility, interoperability, and reuse, especially for users working within the R environment.

##  The proposal {.arg-title5}

## Conceptual Framework: UN Census Data Structure {.smaller .arg-title5}

<br>

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Census Topics
- **Core:** Essential variables  
  (e.g., age, sex, population)
- **Derived-core:** Calculated variables  
  (e.g., fertility rates)
- **Additional:** Country-specific topics  
  (e.g., religion)
:::

::: {.column width="5%"}
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Conceptual Units
- **Population:** Individuals
- **Housing:** Physical dwellings
- **Household:** People sharing a dwelling
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
#### Geographic Coverage
- **National level**
- **Jurisdictional level**
:::

## Conceptual Framework: FAIR Principles {.smaller .arg-title5}

<br>

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.6; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
  <p><strong>Findable →</strong> Six national censuses (1970–2022) in one R package, clearly versioned.</p>
  <p><strong>Accessible →</strong> Open, homogenized datasets with docs & metadata.</p>
  <p><strong>Interoperable →</strong> Tidy tables ready to integrate with other R data.</p>
  <p><strong>Reusable →</strong> Standardized codes, open license, reproducible structures.</p>
</div>

- **Download:** Automated web scraping to collect census tables from official sources.

- **Select:** Listed, classified, and extracted relevant files and metadata (census year, geography, topics).

- **Transform:** Converted Excel tables into tidy, standardized datasets using base R.

- **Function development:** Built R functions to access, manipulate, and visualize the data efficiently.

- **Package creation:** Integrated datasets and functions into the ARcenso package for easy use and reproducibility.

- **Version control:** Used Git and GitHub for tracking changes, collaboration, and release management.

## Citizen Origins, Community Purpose  {.arg-title8}


::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

ARcenso is a citizen-driven initiative that emerged from our professional experience working with census data. 


**It was born from the need for accessible, tidy data among data users, and inspired by the collaborative spirit of the R community.**
